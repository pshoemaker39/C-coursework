Consider a process running the following program:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int globalInt = 10;
int main ()
{
 int i;
 for (i = globalInt; i != 0; i--)
 printf("i = %d\n",i);
 printf("All done!\n");
 return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
Please tell where the following objects are stored in memory.
Your choices are:
(a) ROM BIOS (f) .data segment
(b) kernal Memory (the OS) (g) .bss segment
(c) shared library memory (h) the heap
(d) .text segment (i) the stack
(e) .rodata segment
Where is:
1. (4 Points) the memory for variable 'i'?
--local, heap
2. (4 Points) the memory for variable 'globalInt'?
--stack
3. (4 Points) the for loop?
--.text file
4. (4 Points) the code that turns the string "i = %d\n" to "i = 6\n"
--.text
